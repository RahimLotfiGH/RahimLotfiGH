- 👋<strong> Hi, I’m RahimLotfi </strong>

I am Rahim Lotfi a computer science graduate and developer. With over seven years of experience as a developer, I have worked independently
and with teams and gained a good knowledge of programming languages and the software development life cycle. I love writing well-organized 
and clean code. Colleagues usually praise my clean easily-understood lines of code.
I enjoy refactoring code to make things more clear and easily maintainable. 
I am always open to feedback and never miss a chance to give ideas to improve the status quo. 
I love everything about learning new things and have no attachment to any framework, language, etc. 
To sum it up, an enthusiast learner, a neat coder, 
a helpful team-worker, and a stubborn problem solver with a great sense of humor & flexibility.
